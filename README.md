# Webpage-to-PDF

This project is a Node.js script that uses Puppeteer to convert a webpage to a PDF file. The generated PDF is stored in an outputs directory with a filename based on the base URL of the website and a timestamp to ensure uniqueness.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: You can download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- **Google Chrome or Chromium**: Ensure you have Google Chrome or Chromium installed. You can download [Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) here

## Installation

- Clone the repository or create a new directory for the project:

```sh
mkdir webpage-to-pdf
cd webpage-to-pdf

```

- Initialize the project:

```sh
npm install

```

## Running the Project

- Open your preferred terminal application
- Navigate to the Directory:

```
cd path/to/webpage-to-pdf
```

## Usage/Examples

To run the script and convert a webpage to a PDF, use the following command:

```
node convert.js <website_url>

```

Replace <website_url> with the URL of the website you want to convert to PDF. For example:

```
node convert.js https://example.com/label/title.html
```

The generated PDF will be saved in the `outputs` folder with a filename based on the base URL and a timestamp, e.g., outputs/example-2024-07-26T14-45-30-000Z.pdf.

## Troubleshooting

- **TimeoutError:** If you encounter a TimeoutError: Navigation timeout of 30000 ms exceeded, you can increase the timeout duration in the script by updating the timeout option in the goto method.

- **Executable Path:** Ensure that the executablePath in the script is correctly set to the path of your Chrome or Chromium executable.
